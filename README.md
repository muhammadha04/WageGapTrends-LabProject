Exploring the Evolution of Gender Wage Gap Trends: The Impact of Health, Education, Demographics, and Labor Market Factors
This project aims to investigate the factors influencing the gender wage gap across various OECD countries. Our research question is "How have the gender wage gap trends evolved over time, and can we use machine learning to attribute these changes to shifts in health, education, demographics, or labor market factors?"

Datasets Used
The datasets used in this project were gathered from the official OECD website and WorldBank Gender Statistics database.

Steps Involved
Data Pre-processing: This involved handling missing values, cleaning and filtering the data, and handling outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This involved detecting problems in the data, exploring the features and their collinearity, and evaluating if the data is appropriate for the research question.

Data Biases Analysis: We examined potential biases in the data, such as selection bias, time range bias, and missing data bias.

Feature Selection: We used the Lasso method for feature selection, which chose 75 variables and eliminated 52 variables.

Machine Learning Models: We built and evaluated three machine learning models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The performance of the models was evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric.

Findings
While our analysis provided valuable insights into the gender wage gap, limitations related to data completeness and variable model performance necessitated further refinement of our approach. Our work underscores the complexities involved in analyzing such a multifaceted issue and emphasizes the need for continuous exploration and refinement in our modeling approach.

Acknowledgements
We would like to thank the OECD and WorldBank for making their data publicly available. We also appreciate the OpenAI community for their invaluable resources and support throughout this project.
